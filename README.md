# KylieBitkin's Pixelmon Community Server

Welcome to the install process on how to get onto the community server.

You must be a sub to play. Once you sub runs out you will automatically be removed from the server. Make sure you stay on top of things! You stuff will not be wiped if you lose your sub so you can go a week or two without resubbing and not worry.

We'll first start off with the rules of the server.

# Rules
##### All stream & Discord rules apply here. These include:
- No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc. This should be obvious.
- Don't be toxic.
- Be respectful to others.
- No griefing players.
- No stealing from players unless their land is unclaimed(This is then on them.)
- No stealing from any houses in Mod town. Due to spawn protection some house may let you open chests. If you're caught stealing from these it will be an instant ban and removal from whitelist.
- **No bugging Kylie on the server.**
- No using any exploits that may come from bugs in mods. If caught you will be instantly wiped and all your progress reset.
- No abusing the whitelist system. Do not whitelist other users who aren't subbed. This shouldn't be possible but if you're caught doing so you be permanantly be banned from whitelisting yourself from future servers. 
- No claiming rings around other peoples' bases to stop them from expanding.
- Have fun. This is a server to hangout with other community members and playing a fun game with them.

# Whitelisting

You will need to automatically whitelist yourself on the server. This is only for subscribers. Go to the minecraft text channel on Discord and type !whitelist [MINECRAFT USERNAME]. This will add you to the whitelist. It takes about 5 minutes to update on server side. If you've already whitelisted an account and it is incorrect please contact a moderator and we will get that fixed for you. 

# Installing Twitch Launcher(Skip if you already have it.)

  - Download and install the launcher from [here](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads)
  - Click the mods tab and the minecraft. It'll go through a setup and get Minecraft working.

# Installing the Modpack

- We use the FTB Revelation Lite as a base for the server.
- After clicking Minecraft in the Mods tab, click Browse Modpacks.
- Search for "FTB Revelation". Click install on the one that shows up.
- Once it is installed move onto the next step.

# Installing the Pixelmon mod

- Download the Pixelmon mod from [here](https://dl.reforged.gg/2TZfCbc)(Version 7.0.5 as of writing this.)
- Open the folder in which you downloaded the mod. Keep that in the background.
- Go to the Twitch Launcher and click "My Modpacks"
- Click the image of All The Mods 3. Looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/tYbTRPY.jpg)
- After the window opens click on the cog in the [top right](https://i.imgur.com/BhfSEYP.png)
- Click on "Open Folder"
- Now copy and paste the jar file titled "Pixelmon-1.12.2-7.0.5-universal.jar" into the mods folder that is in the directory that just opened. [This one](https://i.imgur.com/CofmdYy.png)
- From there you are good to click "Play" on the launcher. 
- After getting in game press options, goto controls and scroll down till you see the Pixelmon control settings.
- Set these options to these keys. [Image of keys](https://i.imgur.com/DLMFvrs.jpg). This will let you do most of what pixelmon needs you to do.

# Getting Twitch emotes in game chat.

- On the Twitch Launcher open the ATM3 Lite page like before by clicking the image.
- Click the settings cog again
- Press "Profile Options" and uncheck the "Locked" option. Press Okay.
- Press "Get More Content" it'll be next to the cog.
- Search for Chat Tweaks and install it
- You now got twitch emotes in Minecraft
- To get BTTV and FFZ emotes that are channel specific you'll see a "..." in the bottom right corner. That opens the settings. Dig around there.
#### Updating the All The Mods modpack will force you to go through all of this again.

# Creating and managing your claimed land.

- All players by default are giving 30 chunks to claim. This should be plenty.
- After picking a starter open your inventory and press the 3 people(colored red, blue, and green) in the top left. Create a team.
- After creating a team pressing the map icon in the same area will let you claim land
- Left Click Claims. Right Click Unclaims. Shift-Left Click Chunk Loads. Shift-Right Click Un-Chunk Loads.

# Final Steps

When you join the server before picking a starter press **Ctrl+O(Letter O)** to toggle the JEI overlay. This will let you pick all the starters. Remember this keybind for it is used to toggle back on the JEI interface.
